## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

You should import pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib.pyplot, sklearn. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.



## Project Motivation <a name="motivation"></a>

For this project I selected the Banking Dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/prakharrathi25/banking-dataset-marketing-targets?select=train.csv) (License
CC0: Public Domain) because I wanted to explore the trends regarding term deposits and the marketing activities involved. I wanted to better understand:
1. What are the 2 or 3 most common characteristics of people subscribing in term deposits?
2. What about the campaigns, do they work? 
3. What plan would I follow to attract more clients?



## File Description <a name="files"></a>

There is one notebook in this repository which includes Explonatory Data Analysis, Data Preparation and Modeling. 


## Findings <a name="findings"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://iandreas.medium.com/are-you-into-term-deposits-f0958bf86d90)
